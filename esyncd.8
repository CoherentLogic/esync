.TH ESYNCD 8 "5 September 2014" "Version 0.2.0" "Fourth Watch Infrastructure"

.SH NAME
esyncd - An environment syncing daemon

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B esyncd
.BI "-h " "secondary_host " "-u " "user_instance " directory ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B esyncd
is a daemon that will keep environments synced between a GT.M primary and
secondary instance.
.PP
Normally you wouldn't need to invoke it from the command line. It is
intended to be run by init at system startup. 
.PP
.B The following command line flags are required.
.IP -h
Specifies the hostname of the secondary database instance that you wish to
keep environments synced with.
.IP -u
Specifies the database instance user that should run
.B esyncd.
.PP
You must also supply one or more 
.B directories
for it to watch. It will then keep all files in those directories synced
between replicating database instances. So you add, remove, or modify a
file in one of the watched directories on the primary, and it will
immediately make the same modification on the secondary. Note that it will
not recurse into directories in the directories that you specify.

.SH OPTIONS
There are no additional options.

.SH BUGS
Currently using the select(2) system call without a queue, so during network
failures, files will not be synced, which can cause environments to be out
of sync.
